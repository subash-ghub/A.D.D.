As the global interest in Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) medicine flourishes, the challenge of efficient access and administration remains. To bridge this gap, we propose a revolutionary solution: the AYUSH Automatic Drug Dispenser (ADD). This innovative device leverages a smart technology to streamline the dispensing process, enhance accuracy, and widen accessibility to AYUSH medications. This is mainly to avoid queues and so many aged people and pregnant women can buy their medication and consulting with doctors easily. Imagine a user-friendly interface where patients and healthcare providers seamlessly input prescriptions and select required medications. Powered by a comprehensive database of AYUSH medicines, the ADD precisely identifies, dispenses, and tracks the correct dosage and quantity for each individual. Imagine customizable dosage settings ensuring adherence to treatment plans, real-time inventory management guaranteeing availability, and seamless integration with electronic health records (EHR) systems minimizing medication errors. Furthermore, the ADD empowers patients with remote monitoring and refilling capabilities, fostering convenience and reducing healthcare burden. This technological marvel represents a paradigm shift in AYUSH medicine delivery, seamlessly blending traditional healing wisdom with modern advancements. By ensuring reliable, efficient, and personalized medication management, the ADD has the potential to revolutionize AYUSH healthcare services, promoting holistic wellness and improved patient outcomes on a global scale.
